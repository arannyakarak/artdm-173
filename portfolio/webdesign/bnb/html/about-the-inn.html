                    <h3>LUXURIOUS INN</h3>
                    <p>

                        The Inn – Relax and Refresh at our B&amp;B in Provincetown Village.
                        All seven air-conditioned rooms have queen or king-size beds with luxurious linens, cozy sitting areas, and private baths en suite complete with fresh flowers, chocolates, robes, and a basket of amenities. Each has a fireplace or stove, and several have whirlpool baths.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The common areas invite you to relax by the fire, savor a glass of sherry or port, and visit with your friends or fellow guests.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main house and the carriage house each have a variety of room styles to fit your needs, whether you’re looking for a romantic and cozy room for two or family accommodations for up to four.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Provincetown Village is a perfect location for strolling and exploring the shops, museums, and restaurants that are unique to our town. The Provincetown boardwalk is a short walk from the inn where you can enjoy the beauty of the salt marsh and views across Cape Cod Bay.
                    </P>
